# The Final Project

The issue of Nigerian doctors leaving the country for better opportunities has become a significant concern for the country's healthcare system. 
This study examines the various factors driving the migration of doctors and the potential negative consequences on the healthcare system.  
This project i hope will serve as a wakeup call to the Nigerian legislature to make policies that would make the health care system better.
