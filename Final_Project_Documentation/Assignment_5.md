# Topic:	RESIDENTSâ€™ QUALITY OF LIFE AMIDST COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MAKOKO SLUM COMMUNITY, LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA
# Date:   March 26th, 2023

## Abstract

The aim of this project is to create a web map showcasing the quality of life and resilience measures of residents in Makoko Slum Community, Lagos State, Nigeria, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The web map will include information on socioeconomic characteristics, physical facilities, and factors influencing the residents' quality of life and resilience. 
Data from past research work such as direct observation, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions will be utilized, with Leaflet or Tableau used for web mapping and visualization. 
This project intends to provide policymakers with information that will result in long-term improvements in the lives of slum dwellers.

### 1.1	Overview

This project aims to create a web map that visualizes the quality of life and resilience measures of the residents in the Makoko Slum Community during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The project will examine the socioeconomic characteristics of the residents, the physical characteristics of the facilities in the area, and factors influencing the quality of life and resilience. 
The web map will provide policymakers and stakeholders with valuable information to develop policies and interventions that will improve the lives of the residents in the long term.

### 1.2	Background Information 

The Makoko Slum Community, located in the Yaba Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria, is a densely populated area with poor living conditions. 
According to the World Bank, about 64% of the population in Lagos lives in informal settlements, including slums like Makoko, which lacks basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and health care facilities.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the already precarious situation of the residents, who are vulnerable to the disease due to poor living conditions and inadequate access to health care facilities.

### 1.2.1	Technology

The project will utilize Leaflet or Tableau for the web maps.
Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, while Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that enables the creation of interactive dashboards and maps. 
R will be used for the data visualization and adobe premiere rush will be used in developing a video that shows the status of the community. 

### 1.2.2	Data

The project will utilize both primary and secondary data sources. Primary data from past research work such as direct observation, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions will be utilized. 
The secondary data will be obtained from Esri (modified using QGIS), Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, and available past and present research works. 
The data will be cleaned, processed, and analyzed using R before being visualized on the web map.

### 1.2.4	Potential Challenges 

Some potential challenges that may be encountered in this project include:
- Availability of real-time data, the project will rely heavily on primary data collected in the past
- Limited access to some areas within the community when the primary data was collected.
- Technical challenges while cleaning the raw data to fit my specific need.
- Time constraints due to ongoing project works at the moment
