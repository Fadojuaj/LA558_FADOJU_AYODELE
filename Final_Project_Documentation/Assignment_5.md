## Abstract

The issue of Nigerian doctors leaving the country for better opportunities has become a significant concern for the country's healthcare system. This study examines the various factors driving the migration of doctors and the potential negative consequences on the healthcare system. The study finds that poor remuneration, insecurity, and inadequate diagnostic facilities are the primary driving factors for doctors' emigration. The migration of doctors has worsened the already struggling healthcare system, affecting the quality of care provided to patients, especially in rural areas. The study recommends policy solutions such as an upward review of physician remuneration, analysis and prevention of insecurity, and increased funding for the healthcare sector to improve diagnostic infrastructure and retain healthcare professionals. The study highlights the urgent need to address the root causes of the issue and prevent the collapse of Nigeria's healthcare system.

### 1.1	Overview

This web designed report examines the issue of Nigerian doctors leaving the country for better job opportunities and its negative impact on the country's healthcare system. It highlights the primary drivers of the doctors' emigration, including low pay, insecurity, and inadequate diagnostic facilities. The study suggests possible solutions to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system, such as an upward review of doctor's remuneration, improving security, and increased funding for healthcare infrastructure. The article emphasizes the need to address the root causes of the problem to ensure that the healthcare system provides quality care to patients, especially in rural areas.

### 1.2	Background Information 

Nigeria has been experiencing a massive exodus of doctors over the past few years, with the country losing many of its healthcare professionals to other countries, particularly those in the West. The migration of doctors has been driven by various factors, including poor working conditions, low pay, and a lack of career opportunities.
The healthcare system in Nigeria has also been struggling to meet the needs of its growing population, with a shortage of medical personnel, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and low funding being some of the major challenges. According to statistics, Nigeria has just two doctors for every 10,000 people, far below the World Health Organization's recommendation of one doctor per 600 people. This disparity in the doctor-patient ratio has led to significant health disparities, especially in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited.
The migration of doctors has worsened the already struggling healthcare system, affecting the quality of care provided to patients. This trend could lead to a significant negative impact on the country's healthcare system if not addressed promptly.
