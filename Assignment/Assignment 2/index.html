<h1>Description</h1>

<p>For <b>Assignment 1</b>, For Assignment 1, I successfully carried out two tasks centered on mapping. Firstly, I utilized Open Street Map to mark my hometown, Ijegun in Lagos, Nigeria, which was marked with a location marker. 
  For the second task, I utilized QGIS to produce a choropleth map that illustrates the percentage of the population with access to improved water systems. .</p>
The required data was acquired from the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics website (https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/), while the shapefiles were obtained from ESRI's Living Atlas. 
  I utilized the ID to join the shapefile and data and applied the "Calculate Field" tool to compute the population with improved water systems. The data on the percentages of those with improved water systems was provided by the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics. 
  To determine the population without improved water systems, I calculated the population based on the provided percentages using the "Calculate Field" tool. I then developed the choropleth map to showcase the distribution of the population with unimproved water systems across the states in Nigeria.
  I concluded the task by exporting the map as a geospatial pdf.
  For the final task, I employed the GIS2Web plugin to create a webamp using the choropleth map and changed the assigned coordinate reference system to Nigeria for precise projection.
