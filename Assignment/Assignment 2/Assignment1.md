-For Assignment 1, I executed two tasks centered on mapping.
- Firstly, I utilized Open Street Map to create a map of my hometown, Ijegun, in Lagos, Nigeria, marked with a location marker.
 - In the second task, I utilized QGIS to generate a choropleth map that displays the percentage of the population with access to improved water systems.
- The data was obtained from the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics website [Nigeria National Bereau of Statistics](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/) while the shapefiles were sourced from ESRI's Living Atlas.
 - I used the ID to join the shapefile and data and applied the "Calculate Field" tool to determine the population with improved water systems.

- The data on the percentage of those with improved water systems was provided by the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics.
 - To calculate the population without improved water systems, I used the "Calculate Field" tool.</p>
  - I then created the choropleth map to show the distribution of the population without improved water systems across Nigeria's states.Finally, I exported the map as a geospatial PDF.
  - In the final task, I used the GIS2Web plugin to create a webmap using the choropleth map and changed the coordinate reference system to Nigeria for more accurate projection.
