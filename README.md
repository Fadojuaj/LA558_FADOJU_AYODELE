# LA558_FADOJU_AYODELE
This is the webpage of my repository for LA 558 Spring 2023.
My name is Fadoju Ayodele, and I am a graduate student in the Community and Regional department. My research interests lie in the field of Smart Climate Disaster Recovery and the use of GIS tools in this regard. I am excited to be taking this class on web mapping, as I believe it will provide me with the necessary skills to further my research in this field.

I am looking forward to learning more about R, Tidy Census coding, Tableau, QGIS, and Java/HTML scripting, and how they can be applied to geospatial data analysis and presentation.
