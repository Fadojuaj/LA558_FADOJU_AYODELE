      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a graduate student in the Community and Regional department. 
        My research interests lie in the field of Smart Climate Disaster Recovery and the use of GIS tools in this regard.
        I am excited to take this web mapping class, as I believe it will provide me with the necessary skills to further my research in this field.</p>
      <p>I am looking forward to learning more about R, Tidy Census coding, Tableau, QGIS, and Java/HTML scripting, and how they can be applied to 
        geospatial data analysis and presentation.</p>
        <p>Attached is a map of my home country "NIGERIA". It simply shows diversity.</p>
